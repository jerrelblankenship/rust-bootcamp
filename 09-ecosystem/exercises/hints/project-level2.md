# Project Level 2 Hints: Crate Ecosystem Integration

## 🎯 Specific Dependencies to Fix

Based on the code in the project, here are the missing and broken dependencies:

## 🔧 Missing Dependencies Entirely

These crates are used in the code but not in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Add these missing crates:
anyhow = "1.0"              # Error handling
tracing = "0.1"             # Logging
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"  # Logging setup
uuid = "1.0"                # UUID generation
chrono = "0.4"              # Date/time
csv = "1.2"                 # CSV export
serde_yaml = "0.9"          # YAML export
config = "0.13"             # Configuration
metrics = "0.21"            # Metrics collection
regex = "1.0"               # Email validation
bcrypt = "0.14"             # Password hashing
fastrand = "2.0"            # Random numbers
dirs = "5.0"                # Cross-platform directories
```

## 🎛️ Feature Flags to Fix

These dependencies need specific features enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["postgres", "runtime-tokio-rustls", "uuid", "chrono"] }
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
```

## 🖥️ Platform-Specific Dependencies

Add these with proper platform targeting:

```toml
[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
windows = { version = "0.48", features = ["Win32_System_SystemInformation"] }

[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
nix = { version = "0.26", features = ["process"] }
```

## 🧪 Development Dependencies

Don't forget the dev dependencies for testing and benchmarking:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }
mockall = "0.11"
tempfile = "3.0"
```

## 🔍 C# Comparison

This is like fixing a .NET project where:
- **Missing packages** = Missing NuGet packages
- **Feature flags** = Conditional compilation symbols
- **Platform targeting** = Different target frameworks
- **Dev dependencies** = Test and build-only packages

## ⏰ Time Check

Still struggling after 30 minutes? Move to Level 3 for the complete working Cargo.toml.

**Hint**: Add dependencies in groups - all missing crates first, then fix feature flags!
