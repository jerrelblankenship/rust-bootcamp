# Exercise 07 - Level 1 Hints: Publishing Problems

## 🎯 What's the Problem?

This crate is missing required metadata for crates.io publication and has structural issues.

## 🔍 Check Publication Requirements

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run
```

This will show what's missing for publication.

## 🤔 C# Comparison

This is like:
- **NuGet package metadata** - description, authors, license
- **AssemblyInfo.cs** - version, company, copyright
- **Package configuration** - tags, dependencies

## 🔧 What to Fix

1. **Missing metadata**: authors, description, license
2. **Poor naming**: generic name that might conflict
3. **Library structure**: shouldn't have `main()` function
4. **Missing documentation**: README, examples
