# Exercise 08 - Level 1 Hints: Ecosystem Tour

## 🎯 What's the Problem?

This exercise tries to use many major Rust crates together but has integration issues, missing features, and version conflicts.

## 🔍 Try to Compile

```bash
cargo build
```

You'll see multiple errors about missing features and compilation issues.

## 🤔 C# Comparison

This is like:
- **Multiple NuGet packages** with dependencies
- **Entity Framework + ASP.NET + JSON** integration
- **Missing assembly references** and configuration

## 🔧 What to Fix

1. **Missing feature flags** for multiple crates
2. **Version conflicts** between dependencies
3. **Missing dependencies** (like `tracing-subscriber`)
4. **Database-specific features** for `sqlx`
