# Project Level 1 Hints: Crate Ecosystem Integration

## 🎯 What's the Problem?

The `project-crate-ecosystem` won't compile because of multiple dependency management issues. This is intentional - it's designed to teach you real-world ecosystem navigation!

## 🔍 First Steps

1. **Try to build** and see what breaks:
   ```bash
   cd project-crate-ecosystem
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Read the error messages** - Cargo tells you exactly what's wrong

3. **Identify the error categories**:
   - Missing feature flags
   - Missing dependencies entirely
   - Version conflicts
   - Platform-specific issues

## 🤔 Think About It

- **C# Analogy**: Like fixing NuGet package conflicts and missing assembly references
- **Key Question**: What does each compilation error tell you about missing ecosystem pieces?
- **Strategy**: Fix one category of errors at a time

## 🔧 What to Research

1. **Check the imports** at the top of `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs`
2. **Look for missing crates** that aren't in Cargo.toml
3. **Find feature flag requirements** for the crates that are included
4. **Identify version conflicts** between dependencies

## 📚 Resources to Use

- **[crates.io](https://crates.io)** - Search for missing crates
- **[docs.rs](https://docs.rs)** - Check feature flag requirements
- **`cargo tree`** - See dependency relationships

## 🎮 Systematic Approach

1. **Start with missing crates** - Add dependencies that don't exist at all
2. **Fix feature flags** - Add required features to existing dependencies
3. **Resolve version conflicts** - Make sure versions are compatible
4. **Handle platform-specific code** - Add conditional compilation where needed

## ⏰ Time Check

Spent 15 minutes? If you're overwhelmed by the number of errors, move to Level 2 for more specific guidance.

**Hint**: Focus on one compilation error at a time - don't try to fix everything at once!
