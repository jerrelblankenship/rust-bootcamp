# Project: Advanced Macro System Integration

🎯 **Mission**: Fix a complex macro system project that integrates all advanced patterns!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd project-advanced-macros
cargo build  # Shows intentionally broken code errors
```

## 📝 What You're Building

This project integrates **all Module 10 concepts** into a working macro system:

- **Procedural Macros**: Custom derive and attribute macros
- **Trait Objects**: Dynamic component system 
- **Pin & Async**: Self-referential async components
- **Unsafe Code**: Performance optimizations
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level APIs with low-level performance

## 🔧 Learning Path

### **Step 1: Fix the Dependencies**
```bash
cargo build  # Shows missing dependency errors
```
- Fix the broken Cargo.toml configurations
- Resolve feature flag issues
- Get the basic structure compiling

### **Step 2: Fix the Macro Implementation**
```bash
cd macros && cargo check  # Shows proc macro errors
```
- Complete the procedural macro implementations
- Fix derive macro generation
- Implement attribute macro functionality

### **Step 3: Fix the Integration Issues**
```bash
cargo build  # Shows trait object and Pin errors
```
- Resolve object safety violations
- Fix Pin and async component issues
- Implement safe abstractions over unsafe code

### **Step 4: Verify Everything Works**
```bash
cargo test                              # Run integration tests
cargo run --example integration_demo    # Test the complete system
cargo bench                            # Verify performance
```

## 🆘 When You Get Stuck

1. **Check compilation errors carefully** - They guide you to the problems
2. **Use [Project Hints](../exercises/hints/project-level1.md)** - Progressive help system
3. **Review exercise solutions** - Apply concepts from the exercises
4. **Compare with C# patterns** - Think about Source Generators and reflection

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You've mastered the project when:
- ✅ `cargo build` succeeds without errors
- ✅ All tests pass: `cargo test`
- ✅ Example runs: `cargo run --example integration_demo`
- ✅ You understand how all advanced patterns work together

## 📚 What This Teaches

**Real-World Integration**: This project simulates building a framework like:
- **ASP.NET Core** (attribute-based programming)
- **Entity Framework** (code generation and reflection)
- **SignalR** (async and real-time features)
- **Performance-critical libraries** (unsafe optimizations)

**C# Equivalent Complexity**: Like building a complete framework that uses:
- Source Generators for code generation
- Reflection for dynamic dispatch
- async/await for asynchronous operations
- unsafe code for performance optimization
