# Exercise 08 - Level 1 Hints: Zero-Cost Abstractions

## üéØ What's Going Wrong?

Your high-level code isn't achieving zero-cost abstractions! The compiler should optimize your elegant code into efficient machine code, but performance issues are preventing this.

## üîç First Steps

1. **Try to compile** and see what breaks:
   ```bash
   rustc ex08-zero-cost-abstractions.rs
   ```

2. **Run the benchmarks** to see performance issues:
   ```bash
   ./ex08-zero-cost-abstractions
   ```

3. **Identify the performance problems**:
   - Unnecessary allocations in iterator chains
   - Inefficient string operations
   - Trait objects preventing optimization
   - Closure overhead

## ü§î Think About It

- **C# Analogy**: Like LINQ that should compile to efficient loops but doesn't
- **Key Question**: Why isn't the compiler optimizing these abstractions?
- **Strategy**: Find the performance bottlenecks and eliminate them

## üîß What to Research

1. **Iterator optimization** - How Rust optimizes iterator chains
2. **String allocation** - When strings are allocated vs reused
3. **Trait objects vs generics** - Dynamic vs static dispatch
4. **Compiler optimization** - What prevents inlining

## üìö Resources to Use

- **Rust Performance Book** - Zero-cost abstractions
- **cargo bench** - Benchmarking tools
- **Godbolt** - See generated assembly code

## üéÆ Systematic Approach

1. **Identify allocations** - Find unnecessary memory allocations
2. **Fix iterator chains** - Remove inefficient operations
3. **Replace trait objects** - Use generics where possible
4. **Optimize string operations** - Use efficient string building
5. **Profile your changes** - Verify performance improvements

## ‚è∞ Time Check

Spent 15 minutes? If you're unsure about performance bottlenecks, move to Level 2 for specific guidance.

**Hint**: Look for `clone()` calls and `Vec::new()` in loops - these often prevent zero-cost optimization!
