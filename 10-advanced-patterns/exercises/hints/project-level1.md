# Project Level 1 Hints: Advanced Macro System Integration

## üéØ What's the Problem?

The `project-advanced-macros` won't compile because of multiple advanced Rust pattern issues. This is intentional - it's designed to teach you real-world advanced Rust concepts!

## üîç First Steps

1. **Try to build** and see what breaks:
   ```bash
   cd project-advanced-macros
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Read the error messages** - Advanced Rust errors can be complex but informative

3. **Identify the error categories**:
   - Procedural macro implementation issues
   - Trait object safety violations
   - Pin and async lifetime problems
   - Unsafe code contract violations

## ü§î Think About It

- **C# Analogy**: Like building a complex framework with Source Generators, async state machines, and unsafe code
- **Key Question**: What does each compilation error tell you about advanced Rust concepts?
- **Strategy**: Fix one category of errors at a time

## üîß What to Research

1. **Check the proc macro implementations** in `macros/src/lib.rs`
2. **Look for trait object issues** that break object safety
3. **Find Pin and async problems** in the async components
4. **Identify unsafe code issues** that violate safety contracts

## üìö Resources to Use

- **[proc-macro-workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop)** - Proc macro examples
- **[Pin and Unpin](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/)** - Official Pin documentation
- **[Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)** - The Rustonomicon
- **[Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)** - Async programming guide

## üéÆ Systematic Approach

1. **Start with proc macros** - Fix the macro compilation issues first
2. **Fix trait objects** - Resolve object safety violations
3. **Handle Pin issues** - Fix async and self-referential problems
4. **Address unsafe code** - Ensure safety invariants are maintained

## ‚è∞ Time Check

Spent 20 minutes? If you're overwhelmed by the complexity, move to Level 2 for specific guidance.

**Hint**: Focus on one component at a time - start with the macros since other components depend on them!
