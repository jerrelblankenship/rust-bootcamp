# Progressive Hint System ðŸŽ¯

Tackling advanced Rust patterns? These are the hardest concepts - use hints strategically:

## When to Use Hints

1. **First 20 minutes**: Read compiler errors carefully and try to understand
2. **After 20 minutes**: Check Level 1 hints
3. **After 40 minutes**: Check Level 2 hints  
4. **After 60 minutes**: Check Level 3 hints

## Hint Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ Level 1: Conceptual Guidance
- Explains the pattern's purpose
- References relevant sections in the Rust Book
- Compares to familiar C# concepts

### ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Implementation Strategy
- Shows the general approach
- Points to specific syntax patterns
- Explains common pitfalls

### ðŸ”´ Level 3: Near-Complete Solutions
- Provides working code structure
- Explains why it works
- Leaves final details for you

## Advanced Pattern Mastery

1. **Read Error Messages** - Rust's errors are your best teacher
2. **Use `cargo expand`** - See what macros actually generate
3. **Test Incrementally** - Build complexity step by step
4. **Study stdlib** - See how experts implement patterns
5. **Ask for Help** - Advanced patterns are genuinely hard

## Example Hint Progression

**Exercise**: Fix broken macro hygiene
- **Level 1**: "What is macro hygiene? Check the macro chapter in the Rust Book"
- **Level 2**: "Use `$crate::` to refer to items in the defining crate"
- **Level 3**: "Replace `std::vec::Vec` with `$crate::std::vec::Vec` in your macro"

Remember: Advanced patterns exist to solve real problems. Don't use them just because they're cool!
