# Module 10: Advanced Patterns

Master the most sophisticated Rust patterns by fixing complex code. Dive into macros, trait objects, unsafe code, and zero-cost abstractions!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By fixing advanced broken code, you will:
- Master procedural and declarative macros
- Debug trait object and higher-ranked trait bound issues
- Safely use unsafe code and understand undefined behavior
- Fix pin, phantom types, and zero-sized type problems
- Build sophisticated zero-cost abstractions
- Create a powerful macro-based DSL

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start with the first exercise
cd exercises
cargo build --bin ex01-macro-madness

# When you see cryptic macro errors, that's your advanced learning moment!
# These are the hardest concepts in Rust - take your time
```

## 📚 Module Overview

**Your C# Experience**: You've used reflection, expression trees, generics with complex constraints, and maybe code generation.
**What's Different**: Rust does this all at compile time with zero runtime cost. More powerful, but harder to debug!

## 💪 Exercises - Fix These Advanced Disasters!

Each exercise contains sophisticated broken patterns. Your mission: understand and fix them!

1. **ex01-macro-madness.rs** - Fix broken declarative macros
2. **ex02-proc-macro-panic.rs** - Debug procedural macro issues
3. **ex03-trait-object-trouble.rs** - Resolve object safety violations
4. **ex04-hrtb-headaches.rs** - Fix higher-ranked trait bounds
5. **ex05-phantom-problems.rs** - Debug phantom type issues
6. **ex06-unsafe-undefined.rs** - Fix unsafe code and UB
7. **ex07-pin-projection.rs** - Resolve pin and self-reference issues
8. **ex08-zero-cost-abstractions.rs** - Optimize high-level code to assembly

## 🏗️ Project: Macro-Based DSL

Build a domain-specific language that should:
- Parse custom syntax at compile time
- Generate type-safe runtime code
- Provide excellent error messages
- Support complex nested patterns
- Compete with reflection-based C# solutions

**Starting State**: Macro errors that make no sense!
**Your Goal**: A DSL so elegant it feels like magic!

## 🧰 Debugging Toolkit

- **[DEBUGGING_CHECKLIST.md](DEBUGGING_CHECKLIST.md)** - Advanced pattern troubleshooting
- **Hint System** - Extended hints in `exercises/hints/` (20+ minutes before checking)
- **Reference Docs** - Deep dives in `reference/`

## 🎮 Learning Path

1. **Start here**: `exercises/ex01-macro-madness.rs`
2. **Use `cargo expand`**: See what macros actually generate
3. **Study errors**: Advanced errors require careful reading
4. **Stuck after 20 min?** Check `hints/ex01-level1.md`
5. **All exercises done?** Build your DSL masterpiece!
