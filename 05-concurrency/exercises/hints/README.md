# Progressive Hint System ðŸŽ¯

Stuck on an exercise? Follow this progression:

## When to Use Hints

1. **First 15 minutes**: Work with compiler errors only
2. **After 15 minutes**: Check Level 1 hints
3. **After 30 minutes**: Check Level 2 hints  
4. **After 45 minutes**: Check Level 3 hints

## Hint Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ Level 1: Gentle Nudges
- Reminds you of key concepts
- Points to relevant documentation
- Asks guiding questions

### ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Specific Guidance
- Identifies the exact issue
- Provides C# comparisons
- Shows similar working examples

### ðŸ”´ Level 3: Near-Complete Solutions
- Shows most of the solution
- Explains why it works
- Leaves small parts for you to complete

## Using Hints Effectively

1. **Read the compiler error carefully** - Rust's errors are incredibly helpful
2. **Try multiple approaches** - There's often more than one way
3. **Relate to C# concepts** - Your experience is valuable
4. **Don't rush to hints** - Struggle builds understanding

## Example Hint Progression

**Exercise**: Fix thread safety issue
- **Level 1**: "What trait makes types safe to send between threads?"
- **Level 2**: "You need Arc instead of Rc. In C#, think of it like..."
- **Level 3**: "Replace `Rc::new(data)` with `Arc::new(data)`. Arc stands for..."

Remember: The goal is learning, not just making code compile!
