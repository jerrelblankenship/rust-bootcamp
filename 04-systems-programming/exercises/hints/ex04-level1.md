# Exercise 04 - Level 1 Hints ðŸŸ¢

## Understanding Safe Abstractions

You're building safe APIs over unsafe operations - the art of systems programming! This is like creating a safe C# wrapper around unmanaged code.

## Key Questions to Consider

1. **What makes an abstraction "safe"?** No way for users to cause undefined behavior
2. **How do we maintain invariants?** Careful API design and internal checking
3. **What's the C# equivalent?**
   ```csharp
   // Safe wrapper around unsafe operations
   public class SafeBuffer {
       private IntPtr ptr;
       public void Write(int index, byte value) {
           if (index >= length) throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();
           Marshal.WriteByte(ptr, index, value);
       }
   }
   ```

## Core Concepts

- **Safety invariants**: Rules that must always be true
- **Encapsulation**: Hide unsafe details behind safe interface
- **Error handling**: Return Results instead of panicking
- **Resource management**: RAII with Drop trait

## Common Design Patterns

### Bounds Checking
Always validate indices and lengths before unsafe operations

### Null Pointer Handling
Check for allocation failures and handle gracefully

### Proper Cleanup
Implement Drop to prevent memory leaks

### Iterator Safety
Ensure iterators don't outlive their data

## Building Safe APIs

1. **Start with invariants**: What must always be true?
2. **Design safe interface**: Users can't break the rules
3. **Implement with unsafe**: Use minimal unsafe blocks
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify safety with edge cases
