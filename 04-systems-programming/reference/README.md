- **[unsafe-rust-detailed.md](unsafe-rust-detailed.md)** - Safe abstractions over unsafe code patterns (supports ex02, ex04)
- **[manual-memory-detailed.md](manual-memory-detailed.md)** - Manual allocation, deallocation, and memory pools (supports ex03)
- **[ffi-detailed.md](ffi-detailed.md)** - Foreign Function Interface and C interoperability (supports ex05)

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use These References

### During Exercises
- **Stuck on concepts?** These explain the "why" behind the patterns
- **Need deeper understanding?** Go beyond just fixing the code
- **Curious about alternatives?** See different approaches to the same problem

### For Real Projects
- **Architecture decisions**: Choose the right memory layout strategy
- **Performance optimization**: Understand what makes code fast
- **Safety analysis**: Evaluate unsafe code blocks
- **C integration**: Best practices for FFI

## ðŸ”„ C# Developer Focus

As a C# developer with 20 years of experience, you'll find these comparisons particularly valuable:

| C# Concept | Rust Equivalent | Reference Section |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `unsafe` code blocks | `unsafe` blocks + raw pointers | [unsafe-rust-detailed.md](unsafe-rust-detailed.md) |
| P/Invoke / DllImport | FFI with `extern "C"` | [ffi-detailed.md](ffi-detailed.md) |
| Memory management | Manual control + RAII | [memory-layout-detailed.md](memory-layout-detailed.md) |
| Performance tuning | Zero-cost abstractions | [csharp-comparisons.md](csharp-comparisons.md) |

## ðŸš€ Advanced Concepts Covered

### Memory Management
- Stack vs heap allocation strategies
- Memory alignment and padding
- Custom allocators and memory pools
- RAII patterns for resource management

### Unsafe Code Patterns
- Building safe APIs over unsafe operations
- Maintaining safety invariants
- Raw pointer manipulation
- Manual memory management

### Foreign Function Interface
- C interoperability patterns
- String conversion between Rust and C
- Struct layout compatibility
- Error handling across language boundaries

## ðŸ’¡ Study Approach

1. **Start with exercises** - Get hands-on experience first
2. **Reference when stuck** - Use these for deeper understanding
3. **Compare to C#** - Leverage your existing knowledge
4. **Practice projects** - Apply concepts in real scenarios
5. **Join community** - Learn from experienced Rustaceans

Remember: These are reference materials, not tutorials. The real learning happens through fixing broken code in the exercises!
