# Module 04: Systems Programming

🎯 **Mission**: Master low-level Rust programming with compile-time safety guarantees!

## 🚀 Debug Systems Code Now (2 minutes)

```bash
cd 04-systems-programming/exercises
rustc ex01-memory-layout.rs  # Fix memory layout errors!
```

**The Power**: Control memory like C/C++, but with Rust's safety guarantees!

## 💡 The Systems Programming Revolution

**C has speed** - but crashes, buffer overflows, use-after-free  
**C# has safety** - but garbage collection, slower performance  
**Rust has both** - Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time safety!

## 🔧 Your Learning Path

### **Step 1: Control Memory Layout** (45 minutes)
```rust
// Control exactly how data is arranged in memory
#[repr(C)]
struct NetworkPacket {
    header: u32,    // Exactly 4 bytes  
    data: [u8; 64], // Exactly 64 bytes
}
// Compiler ensures correct alignment and padding!
```

### **Step 2: Write Safe Unsafe Code** (45 minutes)
```rust
// Sometimes you need to break the rules safely:
unsafe {
    let raw_ptr = data.as_mut_ptr();
    // Direct memory manipulation, but contained in unsafe block
}
// Rust ensures safety contracts are maintained!
```

### **Step 3: Interface with C Libraries** (60 minutes)
```bash
cd project-system-monitor
cargo build  # Fix FFI and systems integration
cargo run    # Monitor real system resources!
```

## 🔍 Why This Matters in Enterprise

### **High-Performance Systems**
- **Trading platforms**: Microsecond latency requirements
- **Game engines**: 60 FPS with zero garbage collection pauses
- **Database engines**: Direct memory management for speed
- **Operating systems**: Hardware-level programming

### **Legacy Integration**
- **C library integration**: Reuse existing C/C++ code safely
- **System APIs**: Direct access to OS capabilities
- **Hardware drivers**: Low-level hardware programming
- **Embedded systems**: Resource-constrained environments

## 🔄 C# vs Rust Systems Programming

| Capability | C# | Rust |
|------------|-----|------|
| **Memory control** | Limited (unsafe context) | Full control with safety |
| **Performance** | GC overhead | Zero-cost abstractions |
| **C interop** | P/Invoke marshaling | Direct FFI, zero-copy |
| **Safety** | Runtime checks | Compile-time guarantees |
| **Predictability** | GC pauses | Deterministic performance |

## 🛠️ The Systems Toolkit

### **Memory Layout Control**
```rust
#[repr(C)]        // C-compatible layout
#[repr(packed)]   // No padding between fields  
#[repr(align(16))]// Force 16-byte alignment
struct MyStruct { /* ... */ }
```

### **Safe Unsafe Code Patterns**
```rust
fn safe_wrapper(data: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Validate inputs first
    if data.len() < MIN_SIZE { return Err(Error::TooSmall); }
    
    // Unsafe operations in contained blocks
    unsafe {
        fast_memory_operation(data.as_mut_ptr(), data.len());
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**
```rust
extern "C" {
    fn system_call(param: i32) -> i32;  // Call C functions
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn rust_function(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * 2  // Called from C code
}
```

## 🏆 Success = Systems Mastery

You've mastered this module when:
- ✅ You control memory layout for performance and compatibility
- ✅ You write unsafe code safely within controlled boundaries
- ✅ Your system monitor interfaces with OS APIs correctly
- ✅ You understand when and why to use systems programming techniques

## ⚠️ Systems Programming Safety Rules

1. **Unsafe code is not unsound** - Maintain safety invariants
2. **Contain unsafe blocks** - Minimal scope, maximum safety
3. **Validate everything** - Check bounds, null pointers, invariants
4. **Document safety contracts** - Explain why unsafe code is safe

## 🆘 When Systems Code Goes Wrong

1. **Read the error carefully** - Memory errors are precisely located
2. **Use [Debugging Guide](DEBUGGING_CHECKLIST.md)** - Systems-specific troubleshooting
3. **Check safety invariants** - What assumptions might be violated?
4. **Validate inputs** - Ensure all preconditions are met
