## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These References

### While Working on Exercises
1. **Start with the exercise** - Try to fix the broken code first
2. **Use hints progressively** - Level 1 â†’ Level 2 â†’ Level 3
3. **Consult references for deep understanding** - Come here when you want to learn more

### For Real-World Application
- **[C# Performance Comparisons](csharp-comparisons.md)** - Translate your C# performance knowledge to Rust
- **[Performance Principles](performance-principles.md)** - Apply these concepts to your own projects
- **[Profiling Guide](profiling-guide.md)** - Essential for performance work in any project

## ðŸ”§ Quick Performance Checklist

Before optimizing any code:
1. **Measure first** - Profile to find actual bottlenecks
2. **Algorithm** - Is there a fundamentally better approach?
3. **Memory** - Are you allocating unnecessarily?
4. **Data access** - Are you cache-friendly?
5. **Parallelization** - Can independent work run concurrently?
6. **Micro-optimizations** - SIMD, bounds checking, etc.

## ðŸš€ Performance Mindset

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth

But also:

> "Premature pessimization is the root of all evil" - Andrei Alexandrescu

The key is **measure-driven optimization**:
- Write clear, correct code first
- Profile to find real bottlenecks
- Optimize systematically
- Measure improvements
- Stop when good enough
