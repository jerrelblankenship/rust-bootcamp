# Image Processor Project Hints - Level 1 (Gentle Nudges)

## ü§î Stuck optimizing the Image Processor? Here are some gentle hints...

### üîç Where to Start Profiling

**Question**: Which part of the code is the bottleneck?
- Use `cargo flamegraph --bin image-processor -- sample-images/` to profile
- Look for functions that take the most time
- Check memory allocations with `--memory-profile` flag

### üöÄ Main Performance Issues to Look For

1. **Allocation Storm in `processor.rs`**
   - Look for `Vec::new()` in loops
   - Check for `.clone()` operations  
   - Notice string formatting in hot paths

2. **Sequential Processing in `main.rs`**
   - How many CPU cores are you using?
   - Could images be processed in parallel?

3. **Scalar Operations in `filters.rs`**
   - Are pixel operations processing one at a time?
   - Could multiple pixels be processed simultaneously?

4. **Memory Access Patterns**
   - Are you accessing pixels in cache-friendly order?
   - Are data structures laid out optimally?

### üéØ Quick Wins to Try First

**Question**: What would give the biggest performance boost?
- **Parallel processing**: Use `rayon::par_iter()` for image batch processing
- **Buffer reuse**: Stop creating new Vec on every operation
- **SIMD operations**: Process 4-8 pixels at once in filters
- **Memory pre-allocation**: Use `with_capacity()` for known sizes

### üîß C# Developer Perspective

Think about equivalent optimizations you'd make in C#:
- **Parallel.ForEach** instead of sequential foreach
- **ArrayPool** instead of `new byte[]` in loops  
- **Span<T>** and unsafe code for performance-critical sections
- **System.Numerics.Vector** for SIMD operations

### üìä Performance Targets to Aim For
- **Current**: ~8 images/second (terrible!)
- **Target**: 100+ images/second (professional!)
- **Memory**: <100MB peak usage
- **Latency**: <10ms per image

## üí° Investigation Strategy
1. **Profile first**: Find the actual bottlenecks
2. **Fix biggest bottleneck**: Don't micro-optimize  
3. **Measure improvement**: Quantify each change
4. **Repeat**: Profile ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Measure
