# Progressive Hint System ðŸŽ¯

Stuck on a performance optimization? Follow this progression:

## When to Use Hints

1. **First 15 minutes**: Profile and analyze the bottleneck
2. **After 15 minutes**: Check Level 1 hints
3. **After 30 minutes**: Check Level 2 hints  
4. **After 45 minutes**: Check Level 3 hints

## Hint Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ Level 1: Performance Clues
- Points to the type of bottleneck
- Suggests profiling techniques
- Asks about algorithmic complexity

### ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Optimization Strategies
- Identifies specific inefficiencies
- Shows performance comparison with C#
- Provides benchmark results to target

### ðŸ”´ Level 3: Implementation Guidance
- Shows optimized code structure
- Explains why it's faster
- Leaves final implementation details

## Performance Debugging Process

1. **Profile First** - Never optimize without data
2. **Identify Bottleneck** - Find the slowest part
3. **Understand Why** - Is it algorithmic? Memory? Cache?
4. **Apply Fix** - Make targeted improvements
5. **Benchmark** - Prove the improvement

## Example Hint Progression

**Exercise**: Fix allocation bottleneck
- **Level 1**: "How many times are you allocating? Check with profiler"
- **Level 2**: "You're allocating inside the loop. In C#, you'd use ArrayPool..."
- **Level 3**: "Pre-allocate with `Vec::with_capacity(n)` before the loop"

Remember: 10x performance improvements are common when you fix the right bottleneck!
