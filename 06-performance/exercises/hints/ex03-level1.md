# Exercise 3 Hints - Level 1 (Gentle Nudges)

## ðŸ¤” Stuck on Cache Miss Performance? Here are some gentle hints...

### Checkpoint 1: Matrix Traversal Order
- Look at lines 48-52: `for col in 0..SIZE { for row in 0..SIZE { matrix[row][col] }`
- **Question**: How are 2D arrays stored in memory? Row-major or column-major?
- **Hint**: You're accessing `matrix[row][col]` but iterating `col` first
- **C# parallel**: Same issue with `array[row,col]` access patterns

### Checkpoint 2: Scattered Object Access
- Line 36: `Vec<Box<DataPoint>>` - each DataPoint is in a different heap location
- **Question**: When you access `item.x + item.y + item.z`, are these values next to each other in memory?
- **Hint**: Think C# `class` vs `struct` for data locality

### Checkpoint 3: Binary Search Prerequisites
- Line 64: `data.binary_search(&target)` on `(0..50_000).rev().collect()`
- **Question**: What does binary search require to work efficiently?
- **Hint**: The data is reverse sorted, but binary search assumes sorted data

### Checkpoint 4: Struct Memory Layout
- Look at `BadCounter` struct: `bool`, `u64`, `bool`
- **Question**: How much memory does this struct actually use?
- **Hint**: Think about CPU cache lines (64 bytes) and struct padding

## ðŸ’¡ General Strategy
1. **Think memory access patterns**: Sequential is fast, random is slow
2. **Consider data layout**: Contiguous data = better cache performance
3. **Algorithm requirements**: Some algorithms need specific data arrangements
4. **Cache line awareness**: 64-byte boundaries matter for performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Cache Performance Principles
- **Spatial locality**: Access nearby memory addresses
- **Temporal locality**: Reuse recently accessed data
- **Cache lines**: CPU loads 64 bytes at a time
- **False sharing**: Avoid different threads accessing same cache line

## ðŸ“Š Performance Targets
- Checkpoint 1: <10ms (currently ~50ms+)
- Checkpoint 2: <8ms (currently ~20ms+)
- Checkpoint 3: <5ms (currently ~30ms+)
- Checkpoint 4: <8ms (currently ~15ms+)
