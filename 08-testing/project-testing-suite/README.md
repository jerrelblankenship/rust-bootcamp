# 🧪 Testing Framework Project - Fix the Broken Testing Toolkit!

**Your Mission**: Fix a broken testing framework to create a comprehensive testing toolkit!

## 🎯 The Challenge

This testing framework should provide:
- **Custom Assertions** with great error messages
- **Test Fixtures** and data builders
- **Mocking Utilities** for dependency injection
- **Property-Based Testing** helpers
- **Async Testing** support
- **Test Reporting** and analysis

Currently, **NOTHING WORKS** - it's all broken and needs fixing!

## 🚨 Current State (BROKEN)

- ❌ Custom assertions don't compile
- ❌ Test builders are incomplete  
- ❌ Mocking helpers are missing
- ❌ Property test utilities don't work
- ❌ Async test support is broken
- ❌ No test reporting functionality

## 🔧 Quick Start

```bash
# Try to build (will fail!)
cargo build

# Try to run tests (will fail!)
cargo test

# Try to run demo (will fail!)
cargo run --bin demo
```

## 💥 Known Issues

Your job is to find and fix these testing framework disasters:

1. **🔧 Custom Assertions**: Macros don't compile and error messages are poor
2. **🏗️ Test Builders**: Incomplete builder pattern implementation
3. **🎭 Mock Utilities**: No trait abstractions for mocking
4. **🔄 Property Helpers**: Missing proptest integration
5. **⚡ Async Support**: Broken async test utilities
6. **📊 Test Reporting**: No reporting or analysis features

## 🎮 How to Fix

### Step 1: Fix Compilation Issues
```bash
cargo build
# Fix all compilation errors one by one
```

### Step 2: Implement Missing Features
- Custom assertion macros
- Test data builders
- Mock trait helpers  
- Property test utilities
- Async test helpers
- Basic test reporting

### Step 3: Test Your Framework
```bash
cargo test
# Make sure the framework works correctly
```

### Step 4: Run the Demo
```bash
cargo run --bin demo
# See your testing framework in action
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You've mastered testing framework development when:

- ✅ **All code compiles** without errors
- ✅ **Custom assertions** provide helpful error messages
- ✅ **Test builders** create complex test data easily
- ✅ **Mock utilities** enable dependency injection testing
- ✅ **Property helpers** integrate with proptest smoothly
- ✅ **Async support** enables async test patterns
- ✅ **Demo showcases** all framework features

## 💡 C# Developer Notes

This testing framework mirrors common C# testing tools:

- **Custom Assertions** → Like FluentAssertions or custom Assert methods
- **Test Builders** → Like Test Data Builders and Object Mother patterns  
- **Mock Utilities** → Like Moq setup helpers and interfaces
- **Property Helpers** → Like FsCheck integration utilities
- **Async Support** → Like async Task test patterns
- **Test Reporting** → Like test result analysis tools

The patterns you learn here translate directly to building testing infrastructure in C#!

## 🆘 Getting Unstuck

1. **Start with compilation errors** - Fix one file at a time
2. **Read the FIXME comments** - They guide you to specific issues
3. **Check `hints/` directory** - Progressive hints available
4. **Look at the demo** - Shows how the framework should be used
5. **Test incrementally** - Make one feature work before moving on
