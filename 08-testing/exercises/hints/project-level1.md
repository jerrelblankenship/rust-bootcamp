# Testing Framework Project - Level 1 Hints ðŸŒ±

## Gentle Nudges for Building Your Testing Framework

### Getting Started
**Think about:**
- What makes a good testing framework?
- How do the pieces fit together (assertions, builders, mocks, etc.)?
- What's the minimum viable product to get something working?

### Compilation Issues
**Questions to consider:**
- Have you uncommented the module declarations in `lib.rs`?
- Are all the dependencies added to `Cargo.toml`?
- What does the compiler error tell you about missing implementations?

### Framework Architecture
**Reflect on:**
- How do the modules depend on each other?
- What should be public vs private in your API?
- Which module should you implement first?

### Testing Your Framework
**Consider:**
- How do you test a testing framework?
- What would convince you that your assertions work correctly?
- Can you write meta-tests (tests that test your test utilities)?

### Demo Application
**Think about:**
- What would showcase your framework best?
- How can you demonstrate each feature you've built?
- What real-world testing scenario would this help with?

## ðŸ¤” Still Stuck?

Try these approaches:
1. Start with the simplest module (like `assertions.rs`)
2. Get one assertion macro working before moving on
3. Write tests for your framework as you build it
4. Use the demo app to guide what features you need
5. Look at how real testing frameworks like `mockall` or `proptest` are structured

Remember: You're building the tools that will make future testing easier!
