## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### **60% Doing, 40% Reading**

Unlike traditional tutorials, you learn by **fixing real compilation errors**:

```rust
// ❌ You start with broken code like this:
fn calculate(operation: Operation, a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculatorError> {
    todo!("Implement calculation logic")  // Fix this!
}

// ✅ You end up with production-quality code:
fn calculate(operation: Operation, a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculatorError> {
    match operation {
        Operation::Add => Ok(a + b),
        Operation::Subtract => Ok(a - b),
        Operation::Multiply => Ok(a * b),
        Operation::Divide => {
            if b == 0.0 {
                Err(CalculatorError::DivisionByZero)
            } else {
                Ok(a / b)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **C# Knowledge Accelerator**

Every concept includes direct C# comparisons:

| C# Concept | Rust Equivalent | Key Difference |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `class` | `struct` + `impl` | Composition over inheritance |
| `interface` | `trait` | More powerful, includes default implementations |
| `null` | `Option<T>` | Explicit null handling, no NullReferenceException |
| `Exception` | `Result<T, E>` | Errors are values, not exceptions |
| `using` statement | Ownership + `Drop` | Automatic cleanup without GC |
| `var` | `let` + type inference | Immutable by default |
