# Exercise Hints - Module 01: Foundations

This directory contains progressive hints for each exercise. Use them when you're stuck, but try to struggle with the problems first - that's where the learning happens!

## 🎯 How to Use These Hints

1. **Try the exercise first** - Attempt to fix the compilation errors using the compiler messages
2. **Level 1 hints** - Gentle nudges in the right direction
3. **Level 2 hints** - More specific guidance with Rust concepts
4. **Level 3 hints** - Nearly complete solutions with explanations
5. **Ask instructor** - If you're still stuck after Level 3 hints

## 📚 Available Hints

- [Exercise 1: Hello World](ex01-level1.md) - Basic Rust syntax and printing
- [Exercise 2: Types](ex02-level1.md) - Type system and variable declarations  
- [Exercise 3: Functions](ex03-level1.md) - Functions and control flow
- [Exercise 4: Structs](ex04-level1.md) - Custom types and methods
- [Calculator Project](calculator-level1.md) - CLI calculator implementation

## 🤝 Learning Philosophy

Remember: **Productive struggle is the goal!** These hints guide you toward discovery rather than giving away answers. Each level builds understanding progressively.

### When to Use Hints:
- ✅ After trying for 10-15 minutes on your own
- ✅ When you understand the error but need guidance on Rust syntax
- ✅ When you want to confirm your approach before implementing

### When NOT to Use Hints:
- ❌ Immediately when encountering an error
- ❌ As a substitute for reading the lesson material
- ❌ When you haven't tried using the compiler error messages

The struggle is where learning happens - embrace it! 🦀
