## 🔄 C# to Rust Concept Mapping

| C# Concept | Rust Equivalent | Key Differences |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `class` | `struct` + `impl` | No inheritance, composition preferred |
| `interface` | `trait` | More powerful, can include default implementations |
| `null` | `Option<T>` | Explicit null handling, no NullReferenceException |
| `Exception` | `Result<T, E>` | Errors are values, not exceptions |
| `using` | `use` | Module system instead of namespaces |
| `var` | `let` + type inference | Immutable by default |
| `dynamic` | Not available | Static typing only, safety first |

## 🏃 Quick Start

```bash
# Test the exercises (these now have compilation errors to fix!)
cd 01-foundations/exercises
rustc ex01-hello-world.rs   # WILL SHOW COMPILATION ERRORS
rustc ex02-types.rs         # WILL SHOW COMPILATION ERRORS
rustc ex03-functions.rs     # WILL SHOW COMPILATION ERRORS
rustc ex04-structs.rs       # WILL SHOW COMPILATION ERRORS

# Build the calculator project (this will have compilation errors to fix!)
cd project-calculator
cargo build  # Will show compilation errors - your job to fix them!

# Check your progress against the working solution
# See solutions/README.md for guidance when stuck
```

## 🎓 Learning Path (Updated)

### ✅ Day 1: Environment and Debugging Basics (UPDATED)
- ✅ Complete environment setup
- ✅ Work through "Hello Rust" lesson
- 🔧 **NEW**: Fix compilation errors in exercise 1
- ✅ Understand cargo and project structure
- 🔧 **NEW**: Learn to read and fix Rust compiler errors

### ✅ Day 2: Types and Functions Through Problem-Solving (UPDATED)
- ✅ Study "Variables and Types"
- ✅ Master "Functions and Control Flow"
- 🔧 **NEW**: Fix compilation errors in exercises 2-3
- 🔧 **NEW**: Start calculator project and encounter compilation errors

### 🔧 Day 3: Structs and Complete Implementation (UPDATED)
- ✅ Learn "Structs and Enums"
- 🔧 **NEW**: Fix compilation errors in exercise 4
- 🔧 **NEW**: Fix calculator compilation errors step by step
- 🔧 **NEW**: Run tests to verify your implementations

## 🚀 What You'll Build (Through Discovery)

Your CLI calculator will demonstrate mastery through fixing broken code:

### **Compilation Challenges You'll Solve**
- 🔧 **Define Operation enum**: Add missing variants and methods (currently todo!())
- 🔧 **Implement Expression struct**: Add fields and calculation logic (broken definitions)
- 🔧 **Create CalculatorError enum**: Design custom error types (missing implementation)
- 🔧 **Fix error handling**: Implement proper Result usage (compilation errors)
- 🔧 **Command-line parsing**: Complete argument processing (broken CLI logic)

### **Progressive Difficulty**
1. **Basic compilation**: Make the code compile by adding missing types
2. **Core functionality**: Implement basic arithmetic operations
3. **Error handling**: Add division by zero and invalid input handling
4. **Advanced features**: Complete interactive mode and history
5. **Production quality**: Add comprehensive error messages and help system

### **Learning Through Debugging**
- ✅ **Real compiler messages**: Learn from actual Rust errors
- ✅ **Multiple solution paths**: Different ways to implement features
- ✅ **Guided hints**: Comments and TODOs guide your learning
- ✅ **Test-driven development**: Use tests to verify correctness

## 💡 Tips for C# Developers

1. **✅ Embrace Compilation Errors**: They're teaching tools, not roadblocks!
2. **✅ Read Error Messages**: Rust's compiler gives excellent guidance
3. **✅ Start Simple**: Get basic features working before adding complexity
4. **✅ Use Pattern Matching**: More powerful than C# switch expressions
5. **✅ Think in Terms of Ownership**: Values have single owners by default

## 🎓 Teaching Philosophy - Now Consistent with Module 02

This module now follows the **60% Doing / 40% Teaching** approach proven successful in Module 02:

### **What Changed:**
- ❌ **Removed**: Complete working implementations in exercise files
- ❌ **Removed**: Step-by-step implementation guides
- ❌ **Removed**: Working examples that students could run without fixing

### **What Added:**
- ✅ **Added**: Broken code that students must fix
- ✅ **Added**: Real compilation errors to debug
- ✅ **Added**: Progressive TODO items and guided hints
- ✅ **Added**: Multiple solution paths for each problem
- ✅ **Added**: Comprehensive broken starter code for calculator project

### **Result:**
Students learn Rust fundamentals through a progression from guided examples to independent problem-solving, culminating in a substantial project that requires them to apply everything they've learned by fixing real compilation errors.

**Example of Updated Exercise Approach:**

**Before (Working Example):**
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b  // Students could run this without learning
}
```

**After (Broken Code to Fix):**
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    // TODO: Implement addition function
    // HINT: Return the sum of a and b
    todo!("Implement addition")  // Students must fix this!
}
```

This approach forces students to engage with the material actively and learn from real compiler feedback.
